### About Me
My name is Noah (Landon) Bartley and I am a developer. I usually program in C# but know more programming languages. I've worked on many self-projects so I think I know my way around an operating system and a programming language.

### Programming Skills
A few programming languages I know or are learning more are as follows:

- C#
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++
- C
- Assembly (Specific: MASM)
- Python

And if you are wanting to count web-development languages, I know:

- HTML
- CSS

### Operating System Skills
As someone who is interested in operating systems and is a frequent distro-hopper, I've got used to operating systems and how they work. A few operating systems I know how to use are as follows:

- ReactOS
- Linux Mint
- Ubuntu
- Kali Linux
- Puppy Linux
- A lot of Windows operating systems. Including the older and latest ones.
